I have created this program for practicing python.
I am new to python but i think i am getting better in using gui and lists and arrays specially.
Calculator is ready, there is some part in actionFunction which is frankly done by hit and trail. That part actully mimics old 90's calculators. I will see code again to determine what I have done and how the hell it is working correctly
